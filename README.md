# How to run the analysis

Download the necessary files from here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Open the 'run_analysis.R' script and source it into R. Extract all files and folders and set the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder as working directory in R. You must have installed the 'dplyr' package to run the analysis.

Now just type "run()" and check the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder for the output dataset (this may take a few moments)!
